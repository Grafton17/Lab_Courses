# Signal_Processing
Here I put some of my (janky) hand written Python scripts used for SP.

The purpose of this repository is to keep at hand some functions that I have developed personally in the context of the laboratoy course of my Master degree. Some of these routines already exist in Python, therefore they are just a rough rewriting of more sophisticated and optimized code, while some of them are specifically designed for my lab experiences. 

I have to say, I do not put __ALL__ my code here, but just what would be cumbersome and tedious to rewrite in the possible future.
